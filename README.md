This is me before lunch break while I was listening to the lecture about Gradient descent.

What Is Gradient Descent in Machine Learning?
Gradient Descent is an optimization algorithm for finding a local minimum of a differentiable function. 
Gradient descent in machine learning is simply used to find the values of a function's parameters (coefficients) that minimize a cost function as far as possible.
