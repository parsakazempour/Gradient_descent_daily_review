This is me before lunch break while I was listening to the lecture about Gradient descent.

This is also me after lunch break while I was trying to work on gradient descent repo!

# Definition Of Gradient
A gradient measures how much the output of a function changes if you change the inputs a little bit." — Lex Fridman (MIT)





# What Is Gradient Descent in Machine Learning?

Gradient Descent is an optimization algorithm for finding a local minimum of a differentiable function. 
Gradient descent in machine learning is simply used to find the values of a function's parameters (coefficients) that minimize a cost function as far as possible.
